<span style="font-size: large;"><b>I</b></span> have discovered something profound and life-changing that did not surprise me much at all...

<br />
<br />

That 'something' is that, for my entire life, I have been eating <b>everything I should <i>not</i> have been</b>.

<br />
<br />

What I was is more or less called the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_American_Diet">Standard American Diet</a>", albeit with much higher levels of cheese than most consume, and, objectively speaking, based on research present and past (including long-term historical population health), based on the fact that this is <a href="http://leftbusinessobserver.com/Awfulness.html"><i>the</i> country</a> that appears, for all intents and purposes, to be the world leader in terms of having the <a href="https://sott.net/articles/show/114163">most ill</a>, most medicated, <sup><a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/10/16/american-kids-are-the-most-medicated-in-the-world.aspx">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://naturalnews.com/028561_mainstream_medicine_health_care.html">[2]</a></sup> and most obese, <sup><a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/us-adults-obese-obesity-rate-united-states_n_1210784.html">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html">[2]</a></sup> <a href="http://civileats.com/2012/06/27/the-obesity-paradox-overfed-but-undernourished">most overfed but undernourished</a>, sick <sup><a href="http://reuters.com/article/2009/01/06/us-usa-chronic-idUSTRE5050S920090106">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://chronicdiseaseimpact.com/">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm">[3]</a></sup> population <b>on the entire planet</b>, it is <b>quite clear</b> that it is <i>the</i> least healthy / most self-destructive way for anyone to possibly eat.

			When it comes to things that we, humans, are not adapted to eat and digest, wheat and its gluten protein is probably at the top of the list. It is very sad that wheat is so omnipresent in our society though and many health conditions would probably not even exist if it were not for our high consumption of wheat. <b>Positive changes are often noticed immediately after removing wheat and other gluten containing grains from the diet.</b> <sup><a href="http://paleodietlifestyle.com/11-ways-gluten-and-wheat-can-damage-your-health">[S]</a></sup>

		<u>Dairy products</u>: Cheese, milk, etc. (Excluding eggs, which <a href="http://wisegeek.com/are-eggs-considered-a-dairy-product.htm">are not technically dairy</a>.)
		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			We've been raised on pasteurized dairy, which lacks enzymes and other nutrients we need to digest and assimilate it; raw dairy contains those enzymes and nutrients. Because of the pasteurization of all commercial dairy (except in California) and due to some people's genetic make-up, many of us are either allergic to the casein in dairy or we lack the enzyme, lactase, in our own bodies to digest it. I see a lot of people who don't know they're lactose intolerant or casein sensitive until they take all dairy out of their diet. <b>If you stop eating it for 3 or 4 weeks (sometimes even a few days can be illuminating) and you notice that, for instance, your sinuses clear up, you don't have headaches anymore, your skin looks better, or your digestion is more at ease, then I'd suggest one of two things: take dairy out of your diet or try switching to raw dairy.</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			Here's a <a href="http://raw-milk-facts.com/">great website</a> for finding out more about the history, safety, sources and scientific studies of raw dairy. If you absolutely insist on keeping dairy in your diet and you don't want to eat raw dairy for whatever reason, I strongly suggest at the very least that you only consume organic dairy that comes from pasture-raised cows. It doesn't contain the pesticides that conventional dairy does, and it provides more beneficial fatty acids because the cows ate grass instead of harmful grains. Also, the animals on organic farms are treated far better than they are on conventional factory farms.

<h2>The Timeline</h2>

Simultaneously while <a href="http://beyond-karma.com/how-to/why-we-take-a-peculiar-pleasure-in-suffering-and-how-to-stop">suffering</a> immensely I had been conducting ongoing research into all of the things I had been consuming on a regular basis, such as nearly everything in the above list. In particular, I noticed I was hogging bread, sweets, and other high-carbohydrate products and always felt the 'need' for more, and even called it "black hole mode" because that is what it truly felt like, no end to the need for more.

<br />
<br />

In the process of conducting research and initiating change, I cut out most dairy as the first act, as that had comprised a significant portion of my diet until 2008. But the bread, grains, etc. remained. After moving out to live on my own, I switched to veganism, and again, the bread, grains, processed vegetable oils, etc. remained, but now with high consumption of legumes such as [all manner of] beans, peanuts and soy plus pastas, rice, and sugar cookies, and I noticed no significant difference in feeling better for it. I had never been particularly fond of vegetables or fruits except the ones that tasted particularly sweet, even if not <a href="http://paleoeffect.com/glycemic-index-of-paleo-foods">high-glycemic</a>, so nearly everything I was consuming was processed in some form or another. Furthermore, as nearly anything can technically be made using processed or whole foods, in veganism, "vegan mac and cheese", which used 567 grams of soy cheese per large glass pan, was a weekly or bi-weekly meal.

Processed veganism provided the ultimate experience in terms of pleasure / taste, but technically the worst in terms of feeling ill on more than one level.

<br />
<br />

For some time I had heard of concepts such as "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0658001701">Life Without Bread</a>" and 'paleo' from various sources, including <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/11/11/paleo-goes-mainstream-cbs-news-reports.aspx">Mercola</a>, but only vaguely observed them. It was only at the end of 2011 did these fully enter my consciousness, and I did 'try' them, but it was not true in any sense of the word as high consumption of sodas, table sugar, bread, pastas, potatoes with their skins left on and potato chips, and hard cheese still remained, and thus it barely caused any changes.

<br />
<br />

The misery continued unabated from 2008 to August 2012, when I gave up and forced a particularly long cleansing fast where I came out the other side free of my bread and sugar addictions.

<br />
<br />

In retrospect, having been "stuck in a rut" for years on end because what I was doing was 'abundant', 'affordable', 'cheap', 'tasty', etc. were just <i>excuses</i>. My problem was not that I was a victim, but stuck in victim consciousness. <sup><a href="http://lynneforrest.com">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://melodybeattie.com">[2]</a></sup>

<h2>The Paleolithic / Primal Experiment</h2>

My research on the subject of the 'paleo' / 'primal' diet is summarized in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NcNHPKuI39PBtQrWCX_vzErswF46LE7SGbdL7zEqzew/view">this Google Drive document</a>, which takes most of its information from <a href="http://paleodietlifestyle.com">Paleo Diet Lifestyle</a>, <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com">Mark's Daily Apple</a>, <a href="http://paleoeffect.com">Paleo Effect</a>, and <a href="http://gnolls.org/1141">this comprehensive article</a> at <a href="http://gnolls.org">Gnoll Credo</a>, with the focus primarily on the first and second—but not exact to all four, as I have made up my own mind on some of the conflicts / conflicting information I was presented with.

<br />

But the quick answer is that <b>Atkins is less concerned about food quality than it is about weight loss via restricting carbohydrate intake</b>. (As we'll discuss in a bit, most Paleo eaters end up consuming fewer carbohydrates than most people simply because we avoid grains and processed foods—but unlike Atkins, carbohydrate avoidance ain't necessarily the name of the game.) And super-strict orthodox 'Paleo' eating tends to be more strict than <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/primal-blueprint-101">Mark Sisson's 'Primal' approach</a>, which makes allowances for certain additional foods, like dairy and 'natural' sweeteners.

	<b>A:</b> This is important: <span style="color: magenta;"><b>THERE IS NO ONE DEFINITIVE "PALEO DIET."</b></span> Even cavepeople ate different diets.

<a href="http://leanmachinenyc.com/why-paleo-is-not-a-fad">nor is it a 'fad'</a>:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	A fad diet is used to drop weight quickly and is often centered around a single food. Examples are the grapefruit diet, the cookie diet and the cabbage soup diet.
	<br />
	<br />
	Fad diets tend to be pretty boring and inflexible. The BIG downside to fad diets is that <b>the results are temporary</b>. What usually happens is that someone goes on a fad diet, drops some weight quickly and then regains it <b>plus more</b> the minute they go off the diet. To make matters worse, fad diets usually cause muscle loss, which means you're left with a worse body composition than when you started. <b>Fad diets are completely counterproductive.</b>
	<br />
	<br />
	<b>On the other end of the spectrum are lifestyle diets.</b>
	<br />
	<br />
	Lifestyle diets are used long-term for optimal health and improved body composition. You're making a commitment to creating a healthy, sexy, lean body.
	<br />
	<br />
	Paleo is a lifestyle diet with a special distinction: it's based on <b>the original human diet</b> and developed over the course of millions of years of evolution. <b>Paleo is the diet from a time <i>before</i> there were diets.</b>
</blockquote>

For those who use Facebook, there is a public list titled "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/lists/10150679213528559">Paleo Lifestyle</a>" consisting of over 400 pages all related to the subject in one way or another.

<br />
<br />

In conducting research for this article / personal story, I came across <a href="http://chriskresser.com/food-fascism-and-the-8020-rule">this one</a>, which seemingly has the most open-ended answer, with the site using the term "<a href="http://chriskresser.com/beyond-paleo-moving-from-a-paleo-diet-to-a-paleo-template">paleo template</a>":

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	<b>I think <span style="color: red;">the evidence is crystal clear that wheat, sugar/high-fructose corn syrup and industrial seed oils are toxic to the body</span> and contribute to virtually all modern, degenerative diseases—from diabetes and obesity to heart disease and autoimmunity. There's also <span style="color: red;">substantial evidence that soy, in its processed form (i.e. soy milk, soy protein isolate, etc.) is an endocrine disruptor and anti-nutrient</span> and is best avoided.</b>
	<br />
	<br />
	Beyond that, however, things start to get murky. The Paleo diet excludes dairy products and grains. Yet <a href="http://realmilk.com/">Weston A. Price</a> identified isolated groups of people, like the traditional Swiss Loetschental, who were exceptionally healthy and subsisted primarily on a diet of bread, milk &amp; cheese.
	<br />
	<br />
	Strict Paleo diets also exclude potatoes, claiming that the saponins and glycoalkaloids they contain make them unfit for human consumption. Yet as Stephan Guyenet's recent articles have revealed, it's quite possible to eat a lot of potatoes and be perfectly healthy. In fact, Stephan's <a href="http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2010/12/potato-diet-interpretation.html">most recent article</a> on the subject was about a guy named Chris Voigt who ate nothing but potatoes for two months. Did he keel over and die? Did he get fat? Hardly. He not only lost weight (21 pounds), but also experienced improvements in several other markers, such as a decrease in fasting glucose &amp; triglycerides, and presumably an increase in insulin sensitivity.
	<br />
	<br />
	There's a similar story with legumes and nightshades. They aren't Paleo, but I haven't seen any evidence to convince me that these foods play a significant role in the modern disease epidemic.
	<br />
	<br />
	What about carbs? Low-carb diets are all the rage. And while it's true that very low carb diets can help with weight loss, there's no evidence that they are superior to moderate carb diets (@100g/d) for healthy people.
	<br />
	<br />
	Here's the thing. <b>As convenient as it would be to have a "one-size fits all" diet that works for everyone, we're not robots. We're more diverse than that.</b> Someone who's dealing with an autoimmune disease, leaky gut, arthritis and skin rashes would certainly benefit from a strict Paleo diet and may even need to follow that approach for the rest of their lives. But for someone that is fundamentally healthy, such a diet may be unnecessarily restrictive. They might do perfectly well eating grains (other than wheat), especially when those grains have been properly prepared by soaking and/or sprouting. Dairy is similar. I have patients that tolerate it well in spite of being quite ill (they've removed it for long periods and added it back in without negative effects).
	<br />
	<br />
	In Traditional Chinese Medicine, we also consider the effect of season, geographical location, constitution, state of health and lifestyle when making dietary recommendations. So not only is each person different, what works for one person at one time may not work for that same person at another time.
	<br />
	<br />
	So with this in mind, what do I recommend people eat?
	<br />
	<br />
	The answer, of course, depends on the person. For healthy people, <b>I suggest they follow a high-fat, nutrient dense diet that removes the most significant food toxins (wheat, sugar/HFCS &amp; industrial seed oils)</b>. If they do well with properly prepared grains and raw, fermented or at least organic dairy products, I don't have a problem with that.

As far as 'fanaticism' is concerned with the 'paleo' community, I came across <a href="http://freetheanimal.com/2012/09/oh-my-dear-paleo-what-am-i-going-to-do-with-you.html#comment-215430">this comment</a> on <a href="http://freetheanimal.com/2012/09/oh-my-dear-paleo-what-am-i-going-to-do-with-you.html">this article</a>:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	What was refreshing is, that even though there were, and are different camps of thought about paleo, we all for the most part are independent thinkers, and take what we need in order to fulfill our own individual desires. Never will you see me disparage another individual for eating potatoes, yams, or white rice. <b>If it works for them, then it works for them; simple as that.</b> Who in hell am I to tell another person what to eat in order to claim a piece of group action? By the same token, when others tell me what to eat, or how to exercise in a doctrinaire manner, they will get a monstrous "**** You(!)" emanating from my bellowing lungs. (And yes, I'm talking about so-called paleo folks, as well as the evangelical vegans, and vegetarians.)

my physical, mental, and emotional sense of well-being and "inner peace" have <b>skyrocketed</b> to levels I did not think possible. Did I have cravings for said old things? Of course, and the detox from those was nothing short of <b><i>brutal</i></b>. It appears that, the more addictive something is, the more toxic it happens to be, as made apparent with substances like gluten, refined sugar, and illegal life-destroying narcotics.

<br />
<br />

Cutting out these things, though, does not mean I don't support my local grocery store anymore; I do—I just visit only their meat, fish, produce, and spice sections now. In fact, because of this change, this shift, I do more <i>now</i> to support the local economy than before, because of the attached "<span style="color: blue;">local</span>, <span style="color: blue;">organic</span>, <span style="color: blue;">seasonal</span>" theme. For example, I now shop at local farmers markets, cooperatives, and meat markets for my ingredients, something I <i>never</i> used to do.

Basically, by reconnecting with ourselves, our bodies, the land, and its peoples, we bring the focus back to where it belongs: the locality, the land, the people, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture">local economy</a>. For these reasons and more (such as <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=paleo%20crossfit">physical fitness</a>) are why this is considered by so many to be a 'lifestyle' and not a diet, because the end result is that this and nearly everything related can and often does expand outward, touching all, not just the self.

In spite of backlash against "going low carb" / ketosis in general, <a href="http://ketogenic-diet-resource.com">ketosis</a>—in conjunction with personal experience over the years such as exercising experiments while in such a state, and after some research—is my goal, due to the benefits:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">Contrary to popular rhetoric, a ketogenic, low carb diet is <b>NOT</b> a high protein diet. It's a high fat diet, with a moderate protein and a very low carbohydrate intake. When you reduce the amount of carbohydrate and increase the fat and protein in your diet, it has the effect of switching your body into fat burning mode. <b>Instead of using the easily exhausted sugar from carbohydrates for fuel, your body burns stored fat for energy, and it's this fat burning process which greatly improves health and well-being.</b> In fact, a ketogenic, high fat, moderate protein diet can alleviate many serious health issues.</blockquote>

			<b>1) Improved cardiovascular risk factors</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			Though you may not have heard of it on the front pages of your local newspaper, online news source, or local television or radio news program, saturated fat plays a couple of key roles in cardiovascular health. <b>The addition of saturated fat to the diet <span style="color: blue;">reduces</span> the levels of a substance called lipoprotein (a)—pronounced "lipoprotein little a" and abbreviated Lp(a)—that correlates strongly with risk for heart disease.</b> Currently there are no medications to lower this substance and <span style="color: blue;"><b>the only dietary means of lowering Lp(a) is eating saturated fat</b></span>. Bet you didn't hear that on the nightly news. Moreover, eating saturated (and other) fats also raises the level of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol.

		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			<b>Q: "Isn't all that fat gonna glom onto your arteries?"</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			That isn't how it works. <b>Atherosclerosis is caused by <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/how-to-interpret-cholesterol-test-results">oxidized LDL</a> particles penetrating the arterial wall, inciting <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/how-might-inflammation-cause-heart-disease">inflammation</a>, and damaging the arterial tissue.</b> It is not caused by fat mechanistically attaching itself to the surface of the arteries like fat in a kitchen pipe. Also, it's not like you eat some butter and that butter gets directed straight into your bloodstream. Your blood doesn't have oil slicks running through it, or congealed droplets of grease gumming up the passageways. You are the product of millions upon millions of years of evolution, and I think our bodies can do better than trying to ape modern plumbing.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Response:</b> "My arteries are not pipes. Fat is not solidifying in my blood like it can in the plumbing. Atherosclerosis is a complex process with dozens of factors beyond what's in your diet, let alone the fat content."
		<hr />
		</blockquote>
		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			<b>Q: "Isn't all that cholesterol gonna raise your cholesterol?"</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			If I were a rabbit, sure. When you feed cholesterol to an herbivorous animal, like a rabbit, whose only encounters with dietary cholesterol occur in a lab setting, their blood lipids will increase and they will usually develop atherosclerosis. For many years, the "cholesterol-fed rabbit" was a popular model for studying heart disease and gave rise to the now-popular idea that dietary cholesterol also elevates blood lipids in humans (thus immediately condemning them to a heart attack, naturally). <b>Except it isn't the case.</b> Save for a select few who are "hyper-responders," the vast majority of people can eat <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/cholesterol">cholesterol</a> without it affecting their cholesterol levels. And even when dietary cholesterol affects blood lipids, it's <a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203890">usually an improvement</a>, increasing HDL and the HDL:TC ratio while leaving LDL mostly unchanged. As for where all that blood cholesterol comes from, we make pretty much all the cholesterol in our blood in-house, and <a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8857917">dietary cholesterol tends to suppress endogenous cholesterol synthesis</a>. Boy, between "staying local" and "only making as much as we need," our livers are downright green. I bet our HDL is <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/gmo-monsanto">GMO-free</a> and organic to boot (not so sure about those sneaky LDL particles, though).<br />
			<br />
			<b>Response:</b> "Dietary cholesterol does not affect total blood cholesterol. In fact, when we do eat cholesterol, our bodies make less of it to keep our blood levels in balance."

		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			<b>Q: "Isn't all that fat gonna make you fat?"</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			<span style="color: blue;"><b>Fat doesn't make you fat</b></span>. While you can technically overeat enough fat calories to accumulate adipose tissue, thus getting fat, this is a difficult feat, for two primary reasons:<br />
			<br />
			Fat is <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/curb-your-appetite-high-fat-diet">very satiating</a>, especially when paired with <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/low-carb-flu">low-carb</a> eating. Grass-fed pot roast, ribbed with yellow fat, connective tissue, and ample protein is far more filling than some crusty bread spread with butter. You'll eat a decent slice of the former and be done, but you could easily polish off half a loaf of the latter with half a stick of butter and still be hungry. <b>It's difficult to overeat on a high-fat, low-carb diet.</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			Dietary fat in the presence of large amounts of dietary carbohydrates can make it difficult to access fat for energy, while dietary fat in the presence of low levels of dietary carbohydrates makes it easier to access fat for energy. Couple that with the fact that fat and carbs are easier to overeat together, and you have your explanation. In fact, <b>studies have shown that low-carb, high-fat diets not only <i>reduce</i> weight, they also <a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12077732">retain or even <i>increase</i> lean mass</a></b>. That means it's fat that's being lost (rather than the nebulous 'weight'), which is what we're ultimately after.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Response:</b> "No. Eating a high-fat, low-carb diet is the easiest way to inadvertently eat less without sacrificing satiation or satisfaction. It also improves your ability to access stored body fat rather than lean mass, which is helpful for fat loss."

		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			<b>Q: "But Dean Ornish/my mom/Walter Willet/the AHA/my doctor said saturated fat will give you heart attacks."</b>
			<br />
			<br />
			They all may say that, and sound pretty convincing as they say it, but the science says differently. I tend to listen to the science, rather than what I think the science is saying:<br />
			<ul>
				<li>A 2011 <a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21978979">study</a> found that "reducing the intake of CHO with high glycaemic index is more effective in the prevention of CVD than reducing SAFA intake per se."</li>
				<li>From a 2010 <a href="http://ajcn.org/content/early/2010/08/04/ajcn.2009.29146.abstract">study</a> out of Japan, saturated fat intake "was inversely associated with mortality from total stroke."</li>
				<li>A 2010 <a href="http://ajcn.org/content/early/2010/01/13/ajcn.2009.27725.abstract">meta-analysis</a> found "that there is no significant evidence for concluding that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD or CVD."</li>
			</ul>
			That looks pretty clear cut to me.<br />
			<br />
			<b>Response:</b> "The most recent studies have concluded that saturated fat intake likely has no relation to heart disease, contrary to popular opinion."

nor will the protein content along with ketosis <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/protein-kidneys">mess</a> with the kidneys:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	I'm reminded of the time I had to take Buddha in for a quick checkup at an unfamiliar vet and the woman examining him mentioned that I'd probably want to switch him to a low-protein diet or risk certain renal failure. Because, you know, the kidneys of dogs, close relative of the carnivorous wolf, are unable to process all that <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/the-primal-diet-for-dogs">meat and protein</a>. It's ridiculous on its face, and rather than waste a lot of space debunking what Dr. Eades calls one of the "<a href="http://proteinpower.com/drmike/uncategorized/vampire-myths">Vampire Myths</a>" (it just won't die; get it?), I'll just link to a few papers that have already done so.
	<br />
	<br />
	There's <a href="http://jissn.com/content/1/1/45#B4">this one</a> from the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, a massive review of the evidence in favor of and in opposition to the AHA's weasel warnings about "high protein diets," namely, that people who engage in such risky behaviors as limiting carbs and increasing protein "are [at] risk for ... potential cardiac, renal, bone, and liver abnormalities overall." <b>Long story short: there's far more evidence in opposition to the claim than evidence in favor of it.</b> The AHA recommendations are at best incorrect and at worst deliberately misleading, and the sum of the actual evidence points to protein as being protective against <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/marathon-heart-damage">heart disease</a>, <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/ladies-we-can-stop-with-the-calcium-chews-already">osteoporosis</a>, kidney disease, and liver problems—all things protein is supposed to initiate or worsen.
	<br />
	<br />
	Another <a href="http://nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/2/1/25">review</a>, this time focusing strictly on whether or not protein intake can precipitate kidney disease in healthy people, is even better. I mean, that's the important thing, isn't it? If we want to exonerate or condemn protein, we must study its effects on healthy kidneys. We have to see if it creates problems rather than potentially worsens them. And, <b>according to the exhaustive analysis of Martin et al, there exists no evidence that protein intake negatively influences renal health in otherwise healthy, active individuals</b>. There is some evidence that already impaired renal function might worsen with increased protein, but the experts, as is their wont, can't resist applying the same recommendations to everyone, regardless of renal health. The result is a nutrition teacher sowing misinformation across the student body in an introductory course, i.e. one that is intended to establish foundational knowledge that the students will carry on through life as a cornerstone of their thinking.
	<br />
	<br />
	Simply put, healthy <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/dietary-protein">kidneys can handle plenty of protein</a>; heck, they are <i>meant to handle protein</i>. One of their primary functions is to process the metabolic waste that results from protein metabolism. Yeah, protein 'works' the kidneys, but that's what they're there for! <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/guest-post-building-muscle-101-master-the-basics">Strength training</a> works the muscles. You might even say it strains them. But is that a problem? Compromised kidneys in patients with renal disease (either full-blown or still in development) may not be able to handle as much protein as healthy kidneys, but even that's up in the air—and protein is not the cause of the problem.
</blockquote>

...and <a href="http://medicalnewstoday.com/releases/179311.php">nor will it cause damage in the long term</a>. In fact, as recently discovered, <a href="http://kurzweilai.net/breakthrough-compound-generated-by-low-calorie-diet-blocks-effects-of-aging">going ketogenic can apparently delay or even <i>block</i> the effects of aging</a>:

<blockquote class="blockquote1">"Over the years, <b>studies have found that restricting calories slows aging and increases longevity</b>—however the mechanism of this effect has remained elusive," Dr. Verdin said. He directs the Center for HIV & Aging at Gladstone and is also a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, with which Gladstone is affiliated. "Here, we find that <i>beta</i>-hydroxybutyrate—the body's major source of energy during exercise or fasting—blocks a class of enzymes that would otherwise promote oxidative stress, thus protecting cells from aging," he said.</blockquote>

However, there is no need to stick to it, or anything, so-called 'religiously' unless one is closely in alignment with and <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/listening-to-your-body">listening to their body</a> for any communication.

<br />
<br />

During my time on only water, my body quite clearly entered a full-blown state of ketosis sometime within the first week, and since then has remained there, as the 'same' feeling persists in spite of eating all the delicious things I have been.

I do not swear by this, even though I may already sound like or qualify as an elitist or '<a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=paleotard&amp;defid=5739518">paleotard</a>'. (I have not tried to <a href="http://robbwolf.com/2012/04/04/paleo-diet-convince-it">convince anyone to try it</a>, but I <i>have</i> had difficulty hiding my general excitement over just how awesome this diet is, as well as <i>letting go</i> of even a lingering desire to see those I am living with ditch what they are downing...) The experiment has only recently begun, yet the research into it has extended back half a year, and already I have:

<br />

<ol>
	<li>Faced <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/top-8-most-common-reactions-to-your-grain-free-diet-and-how-to-respond">questions over no grains</a>.</li>
	<li>Received scrutiny as to what I am doing and why.</li>
	<li>Had difficulty dining out due to lack of unprocessed, whole food choices.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>(Except buffets and salad bars. They can be awesome, <i>depending</i>.)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Received comments about the 'stupidity' of this, or why I will not eat [this] or [that].</li>
	<li>Encountered "but cavemen didn't have [this] or do [that]" and so on, and each time I have stated in response: "<i>Metabolic reconstruction</i>, <b>not literal</b>, although physical fitness and natural living is a big part of the vibration inherent in paleo / primal.</li>
</ol>

I have found that the simplest thing is to say that I don't touch gluten anymore and "eat clean" / no processed food, and then proceed to pick and choose what is or is not paleo / primal (such as selecting meat but not using any bread), because trying to explain 'paleo' would probably be too complicated and/or long for conversations, and in fact, in one individual's experience, <a href="http://marksdailyapple.com/forum/thread65585.html">it has been nothing but frustrating</a>:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">My issue here is that they ALWAYS compliment me. They ALWAYS ask how I've achieved such great results, they ALWAYS want to know about my diet.

<br />
<br />

Then, the moment I tell them, they suddenly turn from all "You look great and are really healthy." to "That shit is unhealthy, stop it right now." in like a two-second flip. Ugh!
</blockquote>

(Not everyone, though—as knowledge of this spreads, even some doctors become supportive of it, such as those listed at <a href="http://lowcarbdoctors.blogspot.com">Low-Carb Doctors</a>.)

<br />
<br />

Anyway, I can say that, <i>for the first time in my life</i>, <i>I actually enjoy what I am making and eating</i>, but more importantly, my body does, with <b>no</b> complaints of any kind, yet positive changes include vastly improved endurance, mental acuity, and stamina. Additionally, I also had a ton of fun spending a considerable amount of time researching this subject, arguably more than 40 hours over the course of two weeks.

<br />
<br />

I have not been at this very long, only nearly one month, yet I already see and feel why this is considered a <i>lifestyle</i>—a way of life—and not a diet.

<br />
<br />

Overall? Fascinating, really.
