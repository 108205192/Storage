<span style="font-size: large;"><b>T</b></span>he title is the name I have personally given to sugar—white, refined table sugar, the toxic substance that is virtually inescapable in most processed foods found on American grocery store shelves. This is a substance whose only 'real' benefit is in pleasuring the taste buds, giving the brain a kind of high, and making a whole industry filthy rich, all the while at the expense of so much else, such as being highly addictive (<a href="http://foodaddictionsummit.org/docs/Lenoir_Serre_Article.pdf">more than cocaine</a>) and damaging in the long run.

<br />
<br />

There is <a href="https://sott.net/article/254184">not much I can say differently than others already have</a>, except extensive journaling of how it has affected me since I started an experiment with its consumption in Spring 2009. In summary: Yes, it tastes awesome, but <b>that is all</b>. Now for the negatives, all personally experienced at one time or another, be it during the highs or lows, some from extreme consumption (I'm repeating some in different forms for emphasis):

<br />

<ul>
	<li>Artificial sleepiness.</li>
	<li>Burning eyes.</li>
	<li>Difficulty with endurance during exercising.</li>
	<li>Difficulty focusing.</li>
	<li>Heavy mental fog covering concentration, focus, overall awareness ("<a href="http://healthlady.virtualmissfriday.com/body-detox/dull-brain">dull brain</a>").</li>
	<li>Hyper.</li>
	<li>Hypertensive.</li>
	<li>Lethargy.</li>
	<li>Lightheadedness.</li>
	<li>Liver area sensations.</li>
	<li>Lowered cognitive functions.</li>
	<li>Occasional headache.</li>
	<li>Overall perception dimmed, low.</li>
	<li>Sugar mouth.</li>
	<li>Tingling / vibrating extremities.</li>
</ul>

Basically, a drugged state. There is no 'moderate' amount that is 'acceptable' anymore than there is an 'acceptable' amount for the neurotoxin known as fluoride. <sup><a href="http://fluoridealert.org/">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://nofluoride.com/">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://iicph.org/fluoride_primer">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/07/whats-the-deal-with-fluoride/">[4]</a></sup> I walked around with a kind of "heat haze" clouding my perception, even from minimal amounts of it. For anyone who has <i>not</i> experienced the lack thereof due to <i>never</i> having been off this substance for a significant amount of time, for them it is both unrecognizable and 'normal'—they simply have never experienced anything but. Unfortunately things do not taste anywhere near as entertaining / fun without sugar, but in this case one's health <i>could</i> be placed above such self-destructive pleasure-pandering. Free will being what it is, though, that is up to each individual, of course...

<br />
<br />

Anyway, as if the above list was not complete enough, here is another from <a href="http://glutenfreesociety.org/gluten-free-society-blog/addicted-to-sugar">here</a>:

<br />

<ul>
	<li>heart disease</li>
	<li>cancer</li>
	<li>diabetes</li>
	<li>autoimmune disease</li>
	<li>infection</li>
	<li>yeast overgrowth</li>
	<li>osteoporosis</li>
	<li>fatigue</li>
	<li>headaches</li>
	<li>joint pain</li>
	<li>weakened immune system</li>
	<li>mental fogginess</li>
	<li>PMS symptoms</li>
	<li>moodiness</li>
	<li>hot flashes</li>
	<li>depression</li>
	<li>ADD-like symptoms</li>
</ul>

Was that comprehensive enough? Actually, no... Here is the <b>massive</b> list, <a href="http://nancyappleton.com/141-reasons-sugar-ruins-your-health/">143 Reasons Why Sugar Is Ruining Your Health</a>, complete with sources at the bottom, that is too long to reproduce here. That more or less says that sugar basically causes damage to nearly every aspect of the body in one form or another.

<br />
<br />

But wait, there is more?! Add to the above lists the <a href="http://rhodeislandhospital.org/wtn/Page.asp?PageID=WTN000249">recent research that Alzheimer's may actually be type-3 diabetes</a>:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">"<b>Brain insulin resistance (diabetes) is very much like regular diabetes</b>," de la Monte said. "Since the underlying problems continue to be just about the same, we believe that the development of new therapies would be applicable for all types of diabetes, including Alzheimer's disease, which we refer to as Type III diabetes."</blockquote>

(By the way, aspartame, <sup><a href="http://www.medical-library.net/aspartame_disease.html">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387446/">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://sweetpoison.com/articles/0908/aspartame_history.html">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://wnho.net/fdaapprovedepidemic.htm">[4]</a></sup> high fructose corn syrup, <sup><a href="http://globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/high-fructose-corn-syrup-dangers">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/high-fructose-corn-syrup-dangers_b_861913.html">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://mercola.com/Downloads/bonus/danger-of-corn-syrup/report.aspx">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://naturalnews.com/024466_corn_health_HFCS.html">[4]</a></sup> sucralose, <sup><a href="http://dailyplus.com/Danger-of-Splenda.htm">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://livestrong.com/article/85719-dangers-sucralose">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://naturalbias.com/splenda-isnt-so-splendid">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://splendaexposed.com/">[4]</a></sup> etc. <b>are no better</b>. Sorry.)

<br />
<br />

The only way to change a subconscious program, or habit, is to make oneself <i>consciously aware</i> of it (beginning with stopping and asking what one is doing and <i>why</i> they are doing it, at least for a brief moment). I did that by deciding to experiment with sugar at a time when I had been somewhat avoiding it for a while, however I had more or less consumed it in high quantities consistently throughout my entire life. Now I am off it—virtually entirely. I do miss the sweet taste, as my teas are now bland compared to how they used to be, but I absolutely <b>do <i>not</i></b> miss how it made me feel.

<br />
<br />

<i>Adieu, le sucre doux.</i>

<u>Postscript</u>: I was not going to write a post about this when I discovered that <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/100269352890197596161">+Lyle Lange</a> <a href="http://zooescapee.blogspot.com/2011/02/constant-companion.html">already did</a> (and did well), but decided to anyway since it seems it is worthwhile.
