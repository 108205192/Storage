This post/project, continuously updated, is split into three sections:

<br />

<ol>
	<li>For Readers</li>
	<li>For Establishments</li>
	<li>Current Database <sup><span style="color: red;">2013-10-15</span></sup></li>

</ol>

<h2>For Readers:</h2>

<span style="font-size: large;"><b>T</b></span>his is just an experiment, a "pet project" that was formerly a catch-all map of every known location that either does or does not respect personal choice where footwear or lack thereof is concerned, <sup><a href="http://barefooters.org/key-works/case_for/3.health.html">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://squidoo.com/barefoot-is-best">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://care2.com/greenliving/is-walking-barefoot-healthier.html">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://nymag.com/health/features/46213">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19188889">[5]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://naturallyengineered.com/blog/free-your-feet-barefoot-running-infographic">[6]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://active.com/Assets/Running/barefoot-running-infographic.jpg">[7]</a></sup> and has, after a discussion about such projects, changed direction to be a minimalist gathering of <u>official policies</u>.

<br />
<br />

In general, most would <i>prefer</i> to go barefoot if it were "socially acceptable". <sup><a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreBarefoot">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://barefootandgrounded.com/2011/04/most-of-us-would-go-barefoot-in-public.html">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://anemonecerridwen.net/bfsurvey2013results.php">[3]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes">[4]</a></sup> Unfortunately it is not, at least in the United States (primarily) (some areas <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2MZwaAlfcoU/Ud5JLSck9TI/AAAAAAAAAdA/Rf-9M9D6ETI/s2048/86f629313b5026b8.jpg">are more friendly</a> than others), some parts of the United Kingdom, and also Australia. Conversely, it is quite normal to do so in New Zealand, <sup><a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/striking-number-kiwis-walk-around-barefoot-ny-times-4835491">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071002140800AA68hzf">[2]</a></sup> for example. It is rather hit-or-miss and ultimately has to do with what someone, a group (employees of a store, etc.) or population's notions of what constitutes 'normal' and/or 'acceptable' are, that matters in the end, and not any 'laws' or "health codes" (which only exist for employees). 

<br />
<br />

Only the following are included:

<br />

<ol>
	<li>Multi-location chains, corporations, and franchises, which is where most conduct their business / shopping.
		<ul>
			<li>Standalone ("Mom & Pop") establishments are excluded, as well as hit-or-miss ones with no corporate policy, such as <a href="http://mcdonalds.com">McDonald's</a>, <a href="http://target.com">Target</a>, etc.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>High-traffic locations such as [renaissance] festivals, malls, state fairs, theme parks, zoos, etc. where one is more likely to go barefoot and <i>far</i> more likely to suffer disappointment / embarrassment if evicted due to the fact that visits to such places are most often done in groups.</li>
	<li>Ignoring the above conditions, all locations that are <i>very blatantly</i> (practically advertised as being) barefoot-friendly, such as <a href="http://hodadies.com">Hodad's</a> and <a href="http://togos.com">Togo's</a>.</li>
</ol>

<b>In summary, this project in its current form is less about mapping all locations than showing that, yes, there <u>are</u> places that either passively allow (<a href="http://walmart.com">Walmart</a>) or openly welcome (<a href="https://www.rei.com">REI</a>) those sans footwear</b>.

<br />

If one knows of a place that can be listed, point out their policy via an entrance sign (take a photo?), a website, or correspondence with store management or corporate headquarters that was concluded one way or another. With those in mind: Post a comment to this post or your story to the <a href="http://barefooters.org">Society for Barefoot Living</a>'s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/societyforbarefootliving">Facebook group</a>.

<br />
<br />

Also, if you wish, I can add your barefoot-related blog to the bottom list of links.

<br />
<br />

Lastly, if one knows of any similar projects that are, for example, "catch-all" databases, send me the link? I can include them here as a list.

<br />

<h4>"Catch-All" Databases:</h4>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://livingbarefoot.info/living-barefoot-friendly-establishments">Living Barefoot's</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>For Establishments:</h2>

If you are here on behalf of one, welcome; any questions or concerns will be answered in this section.

<br />
<br />

The five commonly-stated reasons <sup><a href="http://thebarefootbook.com/myths.html">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.barefootandpaleo.com/2013/10/going-barefoot-in-public.html">[2]</a></sup> against bare feet are:

<br />

<ol>
	<li>"It's against state law."</li>
	<li>"The [health code / health department / OSHA] requires it."</li>
	<li>"It's a liability issue."</li>
	<li>"It's a public health issue."</li>
	<li>"It's a matter of decorum and respect."</li>
</ol>

<h3>Responses</h3>

<ol>
	<li>This has been debunked with letters mailed to the health departments of every state, the responses for which were posted <a href="http://barefooters.org/health-dept">here</a>. On a local level, <a href="http://ahcuah.com/bf/govshoe.htm">there are only twelve</a>, with half in Massachusetts alone. Furthermore, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot#Laws">the Wikipedia article</a>.</li>
	<li>Like 1, debunked by the same group. As for the federal <a href="http://osha.gov">OSHA</a> ("<b>Occupation</b>al Safety and Health Administration"), <a href="http://barefooters.org/osha.html">it only applies to employees</a>.</li>
	<li>
		As <a href="http://barefootprof.blogspot.com">Daniel Howell</a>, a professor at Liberty University and author of <a href="http://thebarefootbook.com">The Barefoot Book</a> has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/societyforbarefootliving/permalink/10152015622030311/?comment_id=10152016340780311&offset=0&total_comments=28">said</a>:
		<blockquote class="blockquote1">Over 20,000 women go to the hospital each year because of...high heels. <sup><a href="http://barefootprof.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-is-tyranny.html">[S]</a></sup> <span style="color: red;">In the past 40 years there have been HUNDREDS of lawsuits in which shoes were a mitigating factor</span>; <span style="color: blue;">there has been <b>ONE</b> in which bare feet were a factor</span>. In 1976 a child was FORCED to go barefoot in gym class b/c he forgot his shoes; he fell and got injured; the school lost the suit. But there's a big difference between allowing someone to go barefoot and forcing them to. IF a person were to sue for getting injured while barefoot, they would almost certainly lose the case before either a judge or a jury and in most states the business must be >50% culpable before paying anything, meaning there's more than just bare feet at issue. Any injury that hurts a barefoot person beyond a band-aid (or a few stitches) would certainly hurt a shod person, too. So, yes, it is a myth that bare feet are a liability.</blockquote>
		The <a href="http://barefootalliance.org">Barefoot Alliance</a> has an answer <a href="http://barefootalliance.org/liability">here</a> that explains the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_negligence">comparative negligence</a>" system that is used to determine who is more at fault in injury cases. Bob Neinast @ <a href="https://ahcuah.wordpress.com">Ahcuah</a>, who has extensively hunted for such legal cases, <a href="https://ahcuah.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/more-lack-of-liability-logic">has echoed the same</a>, and compiled a page called "<a href="http://ahcuah.com/injury/index.htm">Footwear (or lack thereof) Injury Cases</a>". As the list shows, far more injuries take place while wearing high heels, shoes, or flip flops, and those who sue can and do win, because the comparative negligence was automatically lower due to their wearing <i>something</i> on their feet.
		<br />
		<br />
		It is for any/all of the above reasons that an outdoor clothing and recreation company, REI, after seeing some customers barefoot and researching to find the same as explained here and elsewhere, <a href="http://barefootprof.blogspot.com/2012/06/is-tide-turning-for-barefooters-rei.html">allows those sans footwear in all their stores nationwide</a>. Additionally, Walmart does as well, but there is no known story surrounding them.
		<br />
		<br />
		Lastly, in the case of persistent concern, <a href="http://barefooters.org/key-works/case_for/2.discrimination.html#2.4">there is the following option</a>:
		<blockquote class="blockquote1">
			Even though bare feet do not pose any real liability risk, if a business owner wishes to post a sign, we think a much more reasonable sign could read:
			<br />
			<br />
			<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;"><b>BARE FEET<br />AT OWN RISK</b></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			Businesses such as auto repair shops have signs that read "NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FIRE OR THEFT", and car washes have "NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITEMS LEFT IN CAR, DAMAGE, OR ANTENNAS". Since there are many such businesses still in existence, implying that they have not been sued into bankruptcy, such signs are apparently sufficient to ward off lawsuits. Therefore, a "BARE FEET AT OWN RISK" sign should also be sufficient while still allowing people to go barefoot if they choose to do so.
		</blockquote>
		(Some carry <a href="http://img51.imageshack.us/img51/1769/cardm.jpg">barefooting cards</a> that are similar in function / intent.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Bare feet only touch the floor, and are washed every time one takes a shower, unlike shoes, which can go months without being properly sanitized (or never are). Contrast with <a href="http://health.state.mn.us/handhygiene/why/5ways.pdf">people's hands</a>, which <a href="http://barefootalliance.org/hygienehealth">touch</a> packages, produce, etc. quite frequently (what of those who are shopping while with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold#Transmission">common cold</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu#Transmission">flu</a>, other contagious ailment, etc.?), not always to keep if they change their mind and put the item(s) back.
		<br />
		<br />
		Those aside, on the subject of health as well, please take into consideration that some who go barefoot do so for <a href="http://teamdoctors.org/why-barefoot">their feet's own physiological health</a>.</li>
	<li>What is considered 'decorum' is ever-changing, and <a href="https://ahcuah.wordpress.com/2011/06/13/how-things-have-changed">back in the 1970s was common enough</a>. However, as has been pointed out, no one is ever evicted from a store for having too many piercings, tattoos (of any kind), wearing too much jewelry or a hat, or unique outfits such as 'goth' clothing or 'furry' outfits, etc. It is only for bare feet that there exists so many negative beliefs, emotions, and perceptions ('dirty', 'poverty', 'unclean', etc.), while the aforementioned get a free pass. <u>See</u>: <a href="https://barefootbrian.wordpress.com/2012/12/31/how-to-handle-a-barefoot-customer">How to Handle a Barefoot Customer</a>, a particularly angry/pissed "<a href="http://dailyimprovisations.com/handling-public-barefoot-confrontations-lies-and-intimidation-at-nampa-winco">Handling Public Barefoot Confrontations—Lies and Intimidation at Nampa Winco</a>" article, and <a href="http://ask.com/question/what-is-cultural-discrimination">Cultural Discrimination</a>, the last link given that many who forgo footwear view it as a lifestyle.</li>
