			It is this honoring of power over reason that makes an authoritarian. The authoritarian loves rules, and loves to apply them.

In general, people just want to be left alone to do their own thing, to live the lives they want to live, create the things they want to create ("let humans be human"), and in the process grow, learn, and ultimately self-improve and be self-empowered—except that this is precisely <b>not</b> what is happening, because the world is and has been deeply ponerized <sup><a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Ponerization">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Ponerology">[2]</a></sup> for some time:

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	<b>Ponerization</b>, from ancient Greek <i>poneros</i> ('evil'), is a term created by <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Andrzej_Lobaczewski">Dr. Andrzej M. Lobaczewski</a> as part of <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Ponerology">ponerology</a>, the scientific study of macrosocial evil. Ponerization is the influence of pathological people on individuals and groups whereby they develop acceptance of pathological reasoning and other pathological characteristics.
	<br />
	<br />
	On the individual scale it can be described as transpersonification, where people susceptible due to a psychological weakness or more severe pathology of their own assimilate the psychology of other pathological people. People not themselves <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Characteropathy">characteropathic</a> or <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Psychopathy">psychopathic</a> may be affected so as to lose the ability to distinguish between healthy and pathological actions and reasoning, accepting <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Paramoralism">paramoralistic</a> and paralogistic justifications and doctrines.
	<br />
	<br />
	On the group scale it consists of either the formation of or the infection of a group with pathological people, resulting in a ponerogenic union (that is, a group that contributes to the formation and development of evil).
	<br />
	<ul>
		<li><i>Primary ponerization</i> (which gives rise to primary ponerogenic unions) involves the forming and development of a group where pathological individuals are active from the beginning. It creates groups that are overtly deviant as is the case with organized crime, and they are generally rejected by society.</li>
		<li><i>Secondary ponerization</i> (which gives rise to secondary ponerogenic unions) is the process where pathological individuals infiltrate a group of normal people and gradually take over its ideology and leadership for their own purposes. The group is eventually divided into two distinct parts—the pathological individuals that have risen to the top and the people below. Such a group, if circumstances are opportune for its leaders, may eventually come to power in society and transform it into a <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Pathocracy">pathocracy</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	Society becomes more vulnerable to ponerization during periods of hysterization, where widespread <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Information_selection_and_substitution">conversive thinking</a> increases susceptibility to ponerization.

<blockquote class="blockquote1">A <a href="http://enpsychopedia.org/index.php/Paramoralism"><b>paramoralism</b></a> (from Greek/Latin <i>para</i>—"alongside, against, counter, beyond"; and <i>moral</i>—"system of ethics and human behaviour") is a linguistic device of persuasion. It is an argument or line of reasoning which is pitched to appear driven by ethical concerns, yet under scrutiny is revealed to be driven by self-interest or adherence to a system of rules disregarding conscience.</blockquote>

At the root, after cutting through everything, this is the only objective, 'true' 'law' or 'rule':

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote3"><span style="color: blue;"><b>Do No Harm</b></span></blockquote>

That said, <b>all</b> rules fall under what is called "Story Reality"

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">
	Story Reality is not the same thing as a subjective reality. Things that go into the Story Reality bin include, stories (factual or fictional), rules (for things like games, or behavior). Things in the Story Reality group are not in the Objective Reality group, and things in the Objective Reality group are not in the Story Reality group.
	<br />
	<br />
	It is easy to see that fictional characters don't really exist and are therefore in the Story Reality category. In other areas it can be more challenging to separate between the two labels. It is in these things were great insight in the realm of reality can be found. For example take the sport of American football. The players, the ball, the playing field, the fans in the stadium are all real, and are Objective Reality. Even the running, throwing and tackling are real, and are Objective Reality. But the rules are Story Reality. If a player catches the ball on one side of a line a whole series of events are triggered, as dictated by the rules of the game. The real player really caught the real ball on a particular side of a real line. But the significance of it (i.e. why people watch) is all Story Reality.

</blockquote>

and as such, it is the individual in question, and not any written (or '<a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bullshitting&defid=2552384">unwritten</a>') code, law, policy, regulation, rule, statute, etc., that is the final arbiter on what is or is not 'allowed', what thus next 'happens' or not, etc.—because what matters in the end is if said individual believes in the "Story Reality"</span>.

<br />
<br />

Here are the factors involved in the enforcement of arbitrary rules:

<br />

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bias&defid=619623">Bias</a>, <a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=discrimination">discrimination</a>, and/or <a href="http://urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=prejudice">prejudice</a>.
		<ul>
			<li>
				With these, such individuals often are ponerized, lacking external consideration (good manners) and respect for free will as a result, and are most likely to cry foul the loudest if subjected to the same treatment on something they wanted to do.
				<ul>
					<li>
						In conjunction, invested emotional belief based on past personal experience(s), "personal preference", and the attitude "because I can", can also factor in.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Perceived (and thus preemptively 'countered') threats ('<a href="http://mandybanderson.com/fear-false-evidence-appearing-real">F.E.A.R.</a>') as the direct result of lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy)">objectivity</a> and knowledge.
	</li>
	<li>The attitude of "just following orders" or "rules are rules", and discernment is required to know what the real agenda / intent is.</li>
</ul>

But "Rules exist for a reason." the saying goes. "Breaking the rules will result in harm." or some other similar statement—being that there are safety rules and regulations, procedures for running systems, etc...

<br />
<br />

Psychology and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology">terminology</a> matter—when we change the words / terms we use, we change our mindset / mental state and thus expectations. Instead of using the terms 'rules', 'regulations', and other synonyms, try '<b>guidelines</b>':

<br />

<blockquote class="blockquote1">A guideline is a statement by which to determine a course of action. A guideline aims to streamline particular processes according to a set routine or sound practice. By definition, following a guideline is never mandatory. Guidelines are not binding and are not enforced. <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guideline">[S]</a></sup></blockquote>

Why bother switching terms? The answer is actually quite simple: Respect cannot be forced.

<br />

<ul>
	<li>A <u>rule</u> is a restriction, the intent behind which is to force a specific path or outcome, and is contractive.</li>
	<li>A <u>guideline</u> is a helpful suggestion (advice) that respects free will, personal preference, etc. and allows for expansion.</li>
</ul>

Generally speaking, the most polite, <a href="http://peacefulsocieties.org">respectful societies</a> tend to have few rules because those living in such know that guidelines are all that are needed. <sup><a href="http://matriarchy.info">[S]</a></sup>

<br />

What would happen if all the rules, codes, statutes, etc. disappeared? In the beginning, and for some time: chaos. ("Primary ponerization" would be the most immediate and obvious danger, with the rapid formation of groups by and of authoritarian types as a result of them no longer being "kept in check" by said "walls of society", but worse so, peaceable self-sustaining communities would be at extreme risk of "secondary ponerization". If there were no government or police to enforce all the rules of the road, for example, would everyone start driving dangerously / insanely, disregarding all notions of courtesy, respect, and safety? Some would—those who never had any real respect for themselves or others to begin with—and the rest would take care to be more careful than they ever have before, to protect themselves and by proxy others.

<br />
<br />

Where arbitrary and similar needlessly-restrictive rules are concerned, consider this: act in favor of yourself and your needs as opposed to directly against another—no acts against, or of force, violence, etc. need to take place except in self-love and self-defense against those who would do immediate, real harm to you and your loved ones; improve yourself, build your own systems, and do it all fully peaceably.

<br />
<br />

So: increase one's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1582702152">frequency</a>, <a href="http://astraldynamics.com">self-awareness</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=self-empowerment">self-empowerment</a>, and <a href="http://foodnotlawns.com">self-sufficiency</a>; acquire information which can lead to experience and thus knowledge; and network with others of like mind to create digital and/or physical communities oriented to one or more expansive, harmonious goals.

<br />
<br />

The next time someone attempts to enforce nonsense on you, stand up for yourself and counter such with facts and knowledge—the illusions disintegrate and walls crumble to dust in the face of such.

<br />
<br />

The world will be a more balanced, better place for it. <span style="color: red;">❤</span>
